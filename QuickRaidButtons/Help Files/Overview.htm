<H1>Overview</H1>

<P>
The basic concept behind the tool is one of spell lines assigned to buttons. In the game you get a series of spells or abilities
that upgrade to more powerful versions at higher levels. You want to use the highest-level version of that spell that you can
given your level. A spell line then is just a listing of the spells/abilities that go together in that series, and the levels at which
you get each one. Spell lines go with a class, so a Warden has a set of spell lines, a Paladin has another (for our purposes,
combat arts and AA abilities are all lumped under "spell", they're abilities you can cast or use). Once you've created the
spell lines for a class, you can <a href="ButtonAssignment.htm">assign them to the 5 quick-raid buttons available to each class</a>.
The assignments are by class, so you assign a Paladin's spell lines to the buttons for the Paladin class, Warden spell lines to the
Warden class's buttons and so on. Once you've got your assignments made, you
<a href="GenerateUICode.htm">generate the ProfitUI quick-raid button text file</a>
and drop it into the UI/ProfitUI folder to use.

<P>
Unlike some tools, here the spell lines and button assignments are stored separately from the generated UI code file. Spell
lines are also stored separately from button assignments. When you create a spell line, it's not lost just because it's not assigned
to a button at the moment. In theory you could pass around spell lines and add them to your own storage without having to
type all the information in yourself. Being able to import and export spell lines is on the to-do list.
